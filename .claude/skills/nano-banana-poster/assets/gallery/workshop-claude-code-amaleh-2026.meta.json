  "prompt": "Create a DRAMATIC and EXCITING workshop announcement poster.\n\nCRITICAL: ALL text MUST be in Hebrew.\n\nBrand: Aviz - The Architect\nColors: Primary #22C55E (bright green), grays #374151, #4B5563, #111827\nStyle: Professional, educational, tech-forward, DRAMATIC\n\nVISUAL CONCEPT - THE HOOK:\nThe avatar (The Architect) is sitting in front of a computer screen, with an expression of EXTREME AMAZEMENT and AWE - his eyes are wide open, jaw dropped, mind blown! \n\nFrom the computer screen, POWERFUL GREEN ENERGY (#22C55E) is EXPLODING outward like a supernova, filling the entire room with glowing green light rays, particles, and magical energy. The avatar is being hit by this wave of power, his hair/clothes blown back by the force.\n\nThe scene should feel like a moment of REVELATION - like discovering something that changes everything. Electric, powerful, transformative.\n\nWorkshop details to include:\n- Title: קלוד קוד אמאל׳ה\n- Subtitle: ה-$100 הכי מנוצלים אי פעם\n- Date: יום חמישי 1.1.26\n- Time: 20:00\n- Platform: Zoom\n- Free workshop indicator: סדנה חינמית\n\nMake the text readable and prominent. The energy should frame the text, not obscure it.\nThe overall feeling should be: \"This is going to blow your mind!\"",
